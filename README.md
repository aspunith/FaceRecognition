# Face Recognition System

This repository contains the implementation of a Face Recognition System as part of the Deep Learning Specialization (Convolutional Neural Networks) by Andrew Ng. The project is inspired by concepts from FaceNet and DeepFace.

## üöÄ Overview

The goal of this project is to build a face recognition system capable of:
- **Face Verification**: Verifying if a person is who they claim to be (1:1 matching).
- **Face Recognition**: Identifying a person among many (1:K matching).

The system uses a pre-trained model to encode face images into 128-dimensional vectors (embeddings). These embeddings are used for comparing and recognizing faces.

---

## ‚úÖ Key Features

- **One-Shot Learning**: Can recognize new faces with just one image.
- **Pre-trained Model**: Leverages a powerful CNN trained on a large dataset.
- **Triplet Loss**: Optimized for learning robust facial features using triplet loss.
- **Dual Functionality**: Supports both verification and recognition scenarios.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/face-recognition.git
   cd face-recognition
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   > **Note**: Compatible with Python 3.8+ and TensorFlow 2.x.

---

## üìå Usage

1. Launch the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Face_Recognition.ipynb
   ```

2. Follow the notebook to:
   - Encode face images to embeddings.
   - Perform face verification (1:1) or recognition (1:K).
   - Add your own images to customize the face database.

## üîÑ Workflow

Here‚Äôs a high-level overview of the system's workflow:

1. **Input**: Face image(s).
2. **Preprocessing**: Resize to 160x160 and normalize.
3. **Encoding**: Use a CNN to convert faces into 128-D vectors.
4. **Comparison**: Compute distances between vectors.
5. **Output**: Verify or identify the person.

## üß† Technical Details

### üîç Face Verification vs. Face Recognition

| Task               | Description                          |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Face Verification** | "Is this the claimed person?" (1:1) |
| **Face Recognition**  | "Who is this person?" (1:K)         |

### ‚ú® Triplet Loss Function

The model is trained using **Triplet Loss**, which ensures:
- The distance between **Anchor** and **Positive** (same person) is minimized.
- The distance between **Anchor** and **Negative** (different person) is maximized.

This helps the model learn a discriminative embedding space for faces.
