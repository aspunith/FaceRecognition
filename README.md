# Face Recognition System

This repository contains the implementation of a Face Recognition system as part of the **Computer Vision CNN Deep Learning Specialization** by Andrew Ng. The project is inspired by concepts from [FaceNet](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.03832.pdf) and [DeepFace](https://research.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/deepface-closing-the-gap-to-human-level-performance-in-face-verification.pdf).

## Overview

The goal of this project is to build a face recognition system capable of:
1. **Face Verification**: Determining if a person matches a claimed identity (1:1 matching).
2. **Face Recognition**: Identifying a person from a group (1:K matching).

The system uses a pre-trained model to encode face images into 128-dimensional vectors. These encodings are then used for verification and recognition tasks.

## Key Features

- **One-Shot Learning**: The system can recognize faces with minimal training data.
- **Pre-trained Model**: Utilizes a pre-trained convolutional neural network for feature extraction.
- **Triplet Loss**: Implements the triplet loss function to optimize the model for face recognition tasks.
- **Face Verification and Recognition**: Supports both 1:1 and 1:K matching scenarios.

## Technical Details

### Face Verification vs. Face Recognition

- **Face Verification**: Answers the question, "Is this the claimed person?" (1:1 matching).
- **Face Recognition**: Answers the question, "Who is this person?" (1:K matching).

### Triplet Loss Function

The triplet loss function ensures that:
- The distance between an anchor image and a positive image (same person) is minimized.
- The distance between an anchor image and a negative image (different person) is maximized.

This helps the model learn robust embeddings for face recognition.
