🚀 Overview
The goal of this project is to build a face recognition system capable of:

Face Verification: Verifying if a person is who they claim to be (1:1 matching).

Face Recognition: Identifying a person among many (1:K matching).

The system uses a pre-trained model to encode face images into 128-dimensional vectors (embeddings). These embeddings are used for comparing and recognizing faces.

✅ Key Features
One-Shot Learning: Can recognize new faces with just one image.

Pre-trained Model: Leverages a powerful CNN trained on a large dataset.

Triplet Loss: Optimized for learning robust facial features using triplet loss.

Dual Functionality: Supports both verification and recognition scenarios.

Edit
jupyter notebook Face_Recognition.ipynb
Follow the notebook to:

Encode face images to embeddings

Perform face verification (1:1) or recognition (1:K)

Add your own images to customize the face database

🔄 Workflow
Here's a high-level overview of the system's workflow:

Edit
Input → Preprocessing → Encoding → Comparison → Output
Input: Face image(s)

Preprocessing: Resize to 160x160 and normalize

Encoding: Use a CNN to convert faces into 128-D vectors

Comparison: Compute distances between vectors

Output: Verify or identify the person



🧠 Technical Details
🔍 Face Verification vs. Face Recognition
Task	Description
Face Verification	"Is this the claimed person?" (1:1)
Face Recognition	"Who is this person?" (1:K)

✨ Triplet Loss Function
The model is trained using Triplet Loss, which ensures:

The distance between Anchor and Positive (same person) is minimized

The distance between Anchor and Negative (different person) is maximized

This helps the model learn a discriminative embedding space for faces.
