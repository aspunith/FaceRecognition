Overview
The goal of this project is to build a face recognition system capable of:

Face Verification: Determining if a person matches a claimed identity (1:1 matching).
Face Recognition: Identifying a person from a group (1:K matching).
The system uses a pre-trained model to encode face images into 128-dimensional vectors. These encodings are then used for verification and recognition tasks.

Key Features
One-Shot Learning: The system can recognize faces with minimal training data.
Pre-trained Model: Utilizes a pre-trained convolutional neural network for feature extraction.
Triplet Loss: Implements the triplet loss function to optimize the model for face recognition tasks.
Face Verification and Recognition: Supports both 1:1 and 1:K matching scenarios.
Project Structure
Installation
Clone the repository:

Install the required Python packages:

Ensure you have TensorFlow and Keras installed. The project is compatible with TensorFlow 2.x.

Usage
Open the Jupyter Notebook:

Follow the instructions in the notebook to:

Encode face images into 128-dimensional vectors.
Perform face verification and recognition tasks.
Customize the database of face images as needed for your use case.

Workflow
Below is a high-level workflow of the face recognition system:

Input: Face images are provided as input.
Preprocessing: Images are resized to 160x160 and normalized.
Encoding: A pre-trained model generates 128-dimensional encodings for each face.
Comparison: Encodings are compared using a distance metric.
Output: The system determines whether the faces match (verification) or identifies the person (recognition).

Technical Details
Face Verification vs. Face Recognition
Face Verification: Answers the question, "Is this the claimed person?" (1:1 matching).
Face Recognition: Answers the question, "Who is this person?" (1:K matching).
Triplet Loss Function
The triplet loss function ensures that:

The distance between an anchor image and a positive image (same person) is minimized.
The distance between an anchor image and a negative image (different person) is maximized.
This helps the model learn robust embeddings for face recognition.
